<h3>A friendly message from Vex, your sub-par bot creator.</h3>
Welcome to the github repo for my Selfbot, intuitively named vexbot2. This is a cleaner and more efficient bot than the first, which,
admittedly, was never posted on GitHub. So you don't care. I'll shut up now.

Some commands are currently being fixed and this is by no means a final version. For instance the set game command is completely fucked, as
I never really finished it, so it is still being worked on.

It goes without saying that this is a new experience for me, I've just started making Discord Bots so a lot of stuff is going to be really
inefficient or downright dumb, but have faith and contribute if you will!

Thanks,
Vex

P.S in the .gitignore is a bunch of un-loved experimental bots, which are all not important. Do you care? No. Cool, me neither.
